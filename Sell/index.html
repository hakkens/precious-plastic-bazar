<div class="h1">How to sell your first product</div>
  <div class="text-area">
    <div class="container">
        <p class="intro paragraph">This page is to help seller post their first item successfully on Precious Plastic Bazar. <br>Before you jump into posting your first items on the platform there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure you (seller) provide the best experience to buyers, make your business thrive and help Precious Plastic Bazar grow into a successful platform that will help reduce plastic waste globally.</p>
          <h3 class="h3">Basics</h3>
            <h2 class="heading">1. Quality</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Quality is at the centre of Precious Plastic Bazar. We require you to only post high quality items. No experiments or try outs but well tested products. Well designed, finely executed, properly finished & polished with professional photography & packaging. This platform can only be successful if everyone keeps the quality level of the items they sell to the max. It’s on all of us. Attention to details, curation, finishing, polishing, packaging, assisting your customers and delivery on time will help to offer the best possible customer experience. This will be a crucial aspect of your, and the Bazar’s, success.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">2. Presentation</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Quality alone is not enough, the way you present your products is also key to your success. A good presentation comes down to proper pictures and an accurate description. The better your presentation, the better your sales. Put care into this, shoot curated photos (maybe on a colored background or using a DSLR?), craft a detailed description of your items that excite and convince buyers your product is what they want.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">3. Accuracy</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Buyers expect to receive what they pay for. You have to try to be as accurate as possible and ensure your items and their descriptions match what you eventually deliver. Color, plastic type, shape, weight or size have to match your claims to maintain your customers happy in the long run. </p>

              <div class="reveal-block">
                <h2 class="heading">4. Profile</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Buyers from Precious Plastic Bazar love discovering the people (you) behind all the awesome items offered on this platform. Because people are at the core of Precious Plastic, we encourage sellers to update their Profile pages in details to share who they are, their unique stories, information about their Precious Plastic workspace, processes, collection practices or folks who help them run their projects. <br>These details are fundamental to inspire curiosity and gain trust from buyers and have a successful experience (selling your items).</p>
                <h2 class="heading">5. Description</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Buyers also want to know how the items they are about to buy are made, picked, collected or created. The story behind your item is a key selling point. And we know your story is worth sharing. Make sure to include as many details in the description of your item about your process, machines, plastics, people helping out, how you collect or how long it took you before you got your product right.</p>
                <h2 class="heading">6. Promptness</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">People enjoy a prompt response or assistance when they needed it. If you receive a message from a buyer inquiring about a product or delivery method make sure to reply within a few hours, not days. If you receive an order for your item send it out for shipment within a day, not a week. Promptness help boost your sales and improve your customer experience (you don’t want to have bad reviews).</p>
